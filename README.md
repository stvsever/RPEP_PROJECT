## Abstract

Belief systems that resist contradictory evidence can make individuals less open to changing their perspective, possibly affecting their ability to effectively navigate complex problem domains. To explore this, 60 participants took part in a 55-minute experiment where they temporarily adopted either refutable (F) or irrefutable (DFU) reasoning styles prior to insight tasks. After exposure to rigid cognitive frameworks, participants in the DFU condition showed:

- **Longer reaction times** on classical and modern insight tasks.
- **Reduced accuracy** in tasks requiring representational change.

A second analysis found that participants with higher chronic affinity for irrefutable reasoning (DFU affinity index) performed worse on classical insight problems. These findings suggest that frequent engagement with irrefutable belief systems may hinder the mental flexibility needed to restructure ideas. Given the relevance to repetitive negative thinking in many psychopathologies, future research should investigate falsifiability as a novel transdiagnostic variable.

## Main Findings

### 1. Effect of Priming Procedure on Insight Performance

> **Note.**  
> A) For classical insight tasks, the DFU condition shows a higher density for longer reaction times compared to the F condition (upper plot). Gaussian model fits across tasks further illustrate between-task variability (lower plot).  
> B) A similar pattern emerges for RAT data: DFU trials yield higher densities at longer reaction times than F trials.

### 2. Association between DFU Affinity and Insight Performance

> **Note.**  
> A) The DFU affinity index correlates significantly with reaction times on classical tasks only. The inverted F index shows correlations with both classical accuracy and modern reaction times, though none survive Bonferroni correction.  
> B) Overall insight performance (BI score) correlates moderately and significantly with DFU affinity; the inverted F index correlation is weaker and marginal.

## Conclusion

These results provide preliminary evidence that irrefutable belief systems impair insightful reasoning by delaying adaptive representational change. The effect is robust under both acute priming and measures of chronic affinity, particularly visible in delayed reaction times. Future studies should employ alternative paradigms and validated materials to replicate and extend these findings.
